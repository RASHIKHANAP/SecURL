The code was written to be read. Please read it, especially if you don't trust
me to build a secure encryption application. In particular:
- Once someone decrypts a link, they can share the original URL as much as they want. Only share encrypted links with trusted people.
- I am not comfortable using JavaScript, and I don't have a firm grasp of the nuances of the language – there may be bugs that I don't even know to check for.
- This is the first project I have ever done using encryption – there is likely a subtle mistake somewhere.
- Most of the encryption/decryption code is based on [MDN tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/deriveKey#PBKDF2_2) for the `SubtleCrypto` API.
